Analysis functions for cricksaw data

## Installation

### Main functions

`pip install 'path/to/cricksaw/analysis'`

### Elastix

Running elastix on camp requires a singularity container and elastix binaries
that are both in `/camp/home/blota/home/shared/resources/elastix`. See 
`scripts/cricksaw-register.sh` for an example of how to use them.
